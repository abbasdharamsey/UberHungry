# UberHungry
This is a Cogs 120/CSE 170 mobile website project. We created a mock website called UberHungry that would allow people to request rides to restaurants together.

This website was only funcitoning in looks but it could not actually help you request an uber. The purpose of the class was to teach you front end, and some back end, web development. This is my first attempt at coding in html5, css, javascript, nodejs, expressjs, handlebars.js, and mongoose.js
